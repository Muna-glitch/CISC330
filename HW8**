CISC 3300 Homework 8: validation, REST, Sessions and Cookies
1. What does it mean to escape data? How does escaping data help us avoid malicious
code?
Escaping data means encoding special characters in our code or data so they arent recognized as code or aren’t reconized as HTML / JS code by browsers in web dev. 
Escaping data helps us avoid malicious code because it ensures that user input is recognized as data and not code, so it prevents XXS code or malicious code injections making a browser more secure. If code is not properly escaped, it can leave data vulnerable to XXS attacks.

2. Please read through: https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest
a. What is REST? What is meant by Statelessness?
REST stands for “Representational State Transfer” which is a style that web developers or anyone can use to design their network applications using HTTP. REST was introduced by Roy Fieding.
Statelessness means that REST systems are “stateless” so servers do not store client or user data, so its simple and allows servers to handle requests independently. 

b. What is a resource?
A resource is any information that can be identified by URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and modified using HTTP methods - resources are images, data, docs, user profiles, and anything else that can be stored or sent, etc.  
c. Look at the section on Path design: In a RESTful architecture paradigm what
would be the proper way to create a path for: (provide URL and HTTP method):
i. getting a list of users?
 GET http:// …url.  /customers
ii. getting a particular user?
  GET http://…url.. /customers/ {id}
iii. saving a user?
 POST http://…url. /customers

3. What is a Cookie?
A cookie is information that a website sends to a user’s web browser when they visit the site and usually if you accept the cookies the user’s info can be stores to remember a little bit of the user’s activity so they can be recognized and catered to in their next visit.
    
4. What is a Session?
  A session is the time frame that a users spends with a site or web app. it begins when they visit and ends when they close it out or exit.
